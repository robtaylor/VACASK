    """
    A generator that traverses a *deck*. 
    
    *depth* is the lowest level to which we traverse the deck. 
    0 dumps only the toplevel file. If *depth* is None the deck
    is traveresed all the way to the bottom. 

    *input_history* is the history up to the *deck*. 

    *parent_line* is the line number on which this *deck* was included. 

    *inside_control* is a flag specifying whether the deck is inside 
    a .control block. 

    It yields 
    * a list of history items which are tuples holding
      * line number in parent file where this file was included, 
        None for the toplevel file. 
      * filename
      * section
    * a line which is a tuple holding
      * line number
      * leading whitespace
      * core line
      * eol comment .. a string or a tuple if the line corresponds 
        to a .include or .lib directive
    * depth at which the line is located
    * a flag indicating this line is a part of control clock
